# Transitioning from synchronous to asynchronou (and somewhere between), by Michael Tempest
    
What is asynchronous working?  Collaboration without the need for instant feedback. 

- Build a backlog for every outcome that we need.
  - Outcomes: Unified team. Everybody knew what we were doing. 
    - Ask anyone what's your plan and they will know.
  - Flexibility: It's always there, you don't have the fear of missing out.
  - Documentation: You don't have to worry about doing documentation follow-up (you already did)
  - Tools: As you have a document that you can send for feedback, that's good enough.
  - Public communications: Not having DMs in slack removes experts in the team and bottlenecks.
    - You are asking people in the team the question, not a single person. 
    - It's great for when someone comes back on holidays.
  - You are asking engineers to manage their own time, deal with asynchronous.
  - Balance: Find what's right.

- Important: next time you are about to put that meeting, make sure that you are giving them enough information.
  - Ask feedback directly. Clear people calendars.
