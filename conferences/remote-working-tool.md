# Shopify remote's working toolbox, by James Steiner 

### 1. The future of work

We went throught the biggest remote experiment in history. It was a watershed moment.
The old normal: 1950, collaboration, serendipity, convenience? 
Our tools now supercede, and are far better than what they had back then.

The world has changed. We owe it to ourselves to remaster our tools for a new era.

### 2. Structuring your org

Shopify went fully remote after the first month of the pandemic. Let chaos reign. 
- How do we structure a global team?
- How can we collaborate and transfer context?
- How do we have an identity?

With each team: 
- Optimise for real time communication (1 to 2 hours diff).
- Organise by rough timezones bands, not countries or locations.
Between teams:
- Optimise for async communication (1 to 2 hours overlap).
- Have an async division/department identity and culture.

Async wider culture:
- Written projects updates
- Video demos
- Written celebrations
- Social channels
- WIth leadership intentionally leaning in

### 3. Onboarding

You sacrifice your identity and lead with impact, so that you can build your high performing teams.
After a year + you have your own identity back.
Essential:
- Great onboarding reduces the time that it takes to get to net positive contribution
- A one-time-only opportunity
A funel:
- Generic -> specialist
- Centralized -> decentralized

In Shopify you spend the first month learning.
- Week 1: mission, values, culture, ship a PR.
- Week 2: dogfooding the product, understanding answers, answering suppor tickets.
- Week 3: Techology, frameworks, architecture, how we get things done.
- Week 4: Self-directed learning (eg: rails 101), manager-lead onboarding path (eg: pairing with team)

The role of good leadership is to accelerate people as quickly as possible

### 4. Norms

Should we tell teams how to organise their work?
Define norms early so that you don't need to explain yourself all the time.

- Autonomy over mandate, freedom over structure, tools over prescriptions.

EX: Define how you think is acceptable communication. Recorded video, length, etc..

### 5. Async and writing

Recommendation: Univeristy of Chicago Leadership Lab, the craft of writing effectively.

What you need to learn as you are writing, is that writing to think is not the same as writing for others.
Ways to improve your writing: Improve documentation
- Have a definition of done
- Try a doc sprint, spent time to writing what happened.

Shift to async, and automate it
- A daily chance to write
Brag doc: What have you achieved?
- A daily chance to write
- Big or small, doesn't matter
- Next step: Share with your lead

Check out: Julia Evans, get your work recognised, write a brag document.

Write an internal newsletter, what have you been working on?
What have you seen?
What are you celebrating?

### 6. Wrap up

Simple writing cna have outsized impact.
