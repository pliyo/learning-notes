# Technical Documentation, by Hila Fish (Senior DevOps Engineer, wix)

If you can't automate it, document it
Self service enablement, increase dev velocity by providing docs that you can share
- Meaningful titles and subheadings
- Links, links, links
- Nobody reads, everybody scans.
Concepts vs tasks. Don't confuse "How tos" vs Explanations.
