# Setting goals as a senior individual contributor, by Sabrina Leandro

- How do you keep context of what is happening around the company?
- Where do you find high impact work?
  - You create it
- Follow this sheet:
  - Commitment: [Write down what you are aiming to achieve here]
    - Ex: define and implement engineering wide metrics for code quality
  - Impact: If you do what you committed to do, what benefits would your team / company see?
  - Role: What is your involvement?
  - Priority: Main or secondary goal?

Once you have that first draft, share it. Ask for feedback from your manager, peers, cross-discipline peers.
Those conversations when you are sharing your goals will help build relationships.
They could become pollinators because you are sharing what you are doing and also why
After that you can share widely, so everyone can see your commitments.
