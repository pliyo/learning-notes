# Scaling Engineering Organizations, by Sangeeta Handa (Engineering Director at Netflix)
    
- You scale the business and you scale the organization.
- These companies plan, have an effor and have an intent.
- The 4th Dimensions:
    - Human Effectiveness.
    - Data Effectiveness.
    - System Effectiveness.
    - Business Growth.
- Two things I have learnt that work for me:
    - Energy embasadors.
      These are the people that are so vibrant with energy.
      They care, they want to have excellence and they will tell you when it's not there.
      Find them and make sure that they are connected with other folks.
    - Power of skipses.
      As organization grows, communicaiton becomes a problem.
      It's important than leaders are able to go one level below their directs.
      Skips are really powerful. Do people really understand what they are trying to achieve?
      It also goes both ways to ensure that they can go above and ensure that their well being is cared.

- Culture of hiring: Hire for what you'll need in 2 years.
    - Every new person that you add is changing the culture of your company.
- Internal hiring: See your own people, don't train them for the jobs they are doing right now,
  train them for the job they should be doing in 2 years from now.
- Am I the best person to make this decision today? Empower people to make their decisions.
  In this context, ensure their objectives are clear.
- You want to do things right, but are you doing the right things?
  When everything is a priority nothing is.

- Tie your impact to the mission of the company. 
  The job of the leaders is to make sure that exists.
    Can everyone in this team say how their efforts contribute to the mission? 
    Are people feeling that they are growing? Are they feeling challenged?
    Do the team has cohesion? Is everybody achieving things together?
- Data Effectiveness.
  - Do you need to test everything? 
  - What are we really measuring here?
  - How can we do rapid experiments?
  - Sometimes you need a hammer and sometimes a bulldozer.
    - ML can't solve everything. But if you invest in ML, make sure you invest in ML/Ops
  - Not only you need to do the scaling that you are doing right now, you also need to do the structure of the future.
  - Plan for loads and your latencies. Do you need horizontal or vertical sharding? How are you going to do all that?
  - For example: Every Feb 28th Netflix renews everybody that has a subscription, because of the billing date. 
    - Plan for your volumes in advance.
