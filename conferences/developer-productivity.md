# Developer Productivity 2.0 by Gergely Orosz

- What is it?
- What practices productive teams follows?
- Why is developer productivity such a hard topic?

In Skype times. Scrum was a success in 2012. Quaterly meetings in all hands were like this:

- "Should we be worried about Whatsapp?"
- "They just do chat, they are just a tool"
- "They just released video..."

Did WhatsApp ever use Scrum? Lesson from WhatsApp: you don't need Scrum.
- From Measuring Software Engineering Productivity:
  - It was a flap
  - My team felt like I didn't trust them
  - I bought into the idea that quantitative data is better than qualitative data
Tools that measure developer productivity don't get as good as you think:
- What are tactics that made your team more efficient?
- What are strategies that helped increase productivity?
  - Vision
  - Strategic iteraction
  - Upfront planning
  - Ownership and autonomy
  - Focus
  - Clarity, clear vision
  - Having a plan
  - Great people: hiring well, growing them
- What are tools that increased productivity?
  - Code
  - Slack
  - Team
  - Continuous test runner
- What things killed productivity?
  - Jira
  - Confluence
  - Meetings
- What was the most productive engineering team that you have worked on?
  - Clear goals, clera direction
  - Small team
  - Good balance between autonomy and business needs
  - Healthy team, good practices
  - Focus
- Why developer productivity uis such a hard topic?
  - Max, formerly tech lead on Google Code Health says:
    - It's a people problem, it's not a technical problem
    - People are complicated
    - It's hard to make the thing argument on what to fix
- Productivity means something different for an ML engineer vs a GO engineer.
  - ML engineers have easily a 2 day feedback loop where they need to wait 
- You don't know what you are measuring, so you aren't going to be able to measure it.
- What are things that don't work?
  - GIT + JIRA stats don't work
    - This only leads to more admin work from developers, creating smaller new tickers, and more commits.
- What are things that do work?
  - Focus on value that you create for the business
    - Ex: All projects completed in last months, with business impact
      - Ex: Generating this much revenue, reducing build time by X person years, etc
      - If this is the only thing that you are doing, you are already haflway there
    - Ask the team what works for them
    - Get qualitative feedback. Without scores. It's hard to do because is words, and is people
    - Eliminate time wasters. It could be that you are waiting too long for other teams, or PRs.
    - Shift left in testing / regressions
    - What works today won't work if the team changes.
- Take your team on the journey with you. In all of these scenarios, success starts before measuring a single thing.
  - If you're tempted to jump on a sales call with a vendor about productivity tools, first stop and talk to your team.
