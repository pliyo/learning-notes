# Leading through turbulence, by Ritesh Manchanda

Turbulence is anything that affects how your team operates.
- Short staffed
- Tight deadlines
External factors
- Layoffs
- Geopoliticals 
- What can you do as a leader?
  - We need to know how to navigate these big challenges
- Why are we still working on this roadmap? Why does it matter?
- Be empathetic and listen. Be transparent and follow up.
- Be selfless and be a champion for your teams.
