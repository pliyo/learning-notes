# Stop! Strategy time, or are we really stopping? by Lena Reinhart (Engineering Leadership & Executive Coach)

How to be strategic
1. Have a strategy
2. Implement your strategy
3. Profit!

- Does this look like your TODO list?
  - Is your team struggling?
  - Are your teammates confused about direction?
  - Are they trying to understand why another round of changes are coming out of the blue?
- Strategy is also what we are not doing. It's where we want to go
  - Vision: goal in the background where we are aiming towards
  - Tactics: actions in front of us
- Intent for the future
- What and why
- Look outward (market, economy)
- Effectiveness (the right thing)
Tactics:
  - Intent turned into daily action
  - How (actions)
  - Look inward (people, capabilities)
  - Efficiency (low cost)
- As a leader, we need both (tactics and strategy): Strategic leadership is leading every single day from an idea to the future
- Strategy will help you increase your impact. Crucial for high team performance, for people to feel impactful
  - Strategic leadership is for everyone, you can be a strategic leader at any level
- How are you spending your time now? vs How you should be spending your time?
- Strategic work requires more context switching. Tactical work is more granular
- Strategic work requires balance with operational work. May bring more change, involves saying no. It's a bet
- We get dopamine when we accomplish small things and we accomplish quick wins. 
  - It can be really tempting keeping us stuck in the tactical work
- Strategic leadership isn't about the documents you write, it's about your habits:
  - The way you think and spend your time is the kind of leader you are
- Make strategic leadership your habit
  - You need to be able to zoom out to think on the big picture
  - You need to be able to zoom in. Taking actions, setting boundaries (it's also saying no)
    - Broadcasting what you are doing.
  - Repetition (daily actions, weekly, as well as quaterly)
  - STABB = Space, Think, Act, Boundaries, Broadcast

- **Daily work**: Start your work day with 15 minutes of strategy time.
  - Make some space to think first, and reflect on 4 strategic questions:
    - What is the most important thing for us?
    - What are we not doing to accomplish it?
    - How can I help my team draw connections between their work and strategy?
    - How am I investing in capabilities we need to meet our strategic goals?
- **Every day ask strategic questions**
  - What buusiness problems are we trying to solve?
  - What assumptions are we making?
  - What are our blindspots?
  - How does this issue affect other areas of the business?
  - How will this move us toward our organisation's strategy?
  - What's the long term impact?
- Focus on what matters, communicate it for alignment
  - What should I stop doing today?
    - Make a conscious ecision about what you are leaving from your TODO list
- **Weekly:** 30 mins blocks of strategy time.
  - World
  - Industry, trends
  - Company, including customers
  - Department, teams.
  - What am I seeing? hearing?
  - What could it mean for our company?
- Hone your strategic thinking, and keep track of what your teams are doing so you aren't getting disconnected.
- Look beyond your current assumptions, consider big picture impacts. 
- Communicate to align:
  - Decision, immediate benefits, drawbacks
    - Future consequences, benefits, drawbacks
      - Future consequences, benefits, drawbacks
    - Choose options with positive 2nd and 3rd order consequences (short term pain, long term gain)
    - Reminder: review decisions after 3/6 months
- **Actively connect your team with strategy**
  - Why are we (not) doing X?
  - What does success look like?
  - How does our work connect with the big picture?
  - Here's what I learned this week
- **Boundaries and broadcasting**
  - Where can we add the highest value?
  - What's most important to the organization?
  - What could we do to achieve more, better, faster?
  - What should we stop doing?
- Quaterly: Review previous quarter with your team
  - What did I/we learn about:
    - Decisions
    - Progress
    - Risks
    - Impediments
    - What's (not) working
    - How can we apply these lessons?
- Space for strategic review
  - Analyse your existing strategy, adjust if needed
  - Based on what I know, is our strategy still the right strategy?
    - Consistency
    - Available resources
    - Degree of risk
    - Time horizon
    - Workability
- Plan with your team
  - Where are we now?
  - Where do we want to be?
  - How do we plan to get there?
- Make strategic leadership your habit.
