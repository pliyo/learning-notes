# The Making of a Manager's Manager, by Anita Singh (Director of Engineering, Gorillas)

- I've done the transition from IC to being a Manager. 
  - Surely from being one kind of manager to another is going to be an easy transition?? Wrong!
- The journey begins at the cross-roads
  - Would you actually like your manager's job?
- Recomendation: An Engineering Manager's Bill of Rights, by Emily Nakashima
- Still be middle management
  - As a manager's manager you are now responsible for multiple teams, and their managers.
  - The layers switch, but you are still going to be doing some middle management work.
  - There is an increase in power dynamics and less control that you had before
  - When you become director there are really few shots that you can call by yourself
  - You really want to have an anchor that you are really excited about and that you want to learn
- Fill in gaps to help the business succeed
  - There are processes that can be improved.
  - Raising your hands and taking action can pay dividends for your career
  - Take work off your manager's place is a great way to test the water before jumping into your manager's place
  - Start mentoring and building a community
- What rituals make sense that you are part of?
- `I love reading RFCs, to learn how engineers are collaborating with each other`
- Skip level meetings are invaluable to help meet your indirect reports
- Demos are not about you, is about them
- When evaluating RFCs, you don't want to get into a nitty gritty
  - An engineer might do what you suggest because of your title, not because is the thing to do
- Do not send any calendar invites without any context to your engineers
- 1:1s:
  - Their topics <> Their team's topic
  - Have them prioritise themselves before their teams.
    - Managers have to put an oxygen masks first before helping others.
    - Reinforce the idea that you want to hear from them
- You are being watched.
  - Prepare upfront your communication as much as you can.
  - Be really intentional about your actions and your words.
  - Every interaction is an opportunity to shape the culture
    - Ex: In a postmortem someone blaming other engineer, is both what you do and you don't that shapes the culture
- Mistakes:
  - Limiting my first team to only peers in our department
    - Didn't spend the same energy in peers outside of the department (Head of)
  - Your first team is your leadership team
  - You have to strategise and prioritise some relationships over others
  - Still doing the old job, and not giving up control sooner
    - This can be destructive in this manager of managers role
    - You have to give back control
- Self care:
  - It's isolating and lonely to be a manager because you have an isolated experience
  - Mistakes feel worse as they impact more people
  - Abuse can happen upwards as well
  - Have your peer group and get frequent feedback
- `Managing managers have been the most rewarding role I ever had`
