  - There is a lot going on for an Engineering Manager
    - Project Delivery
    - People Management
    - Organizational Work
- Use system thinking to drive your focus. What is system thinking?
  - System thinking is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than splitting it down into parts.
- W. Deming: `A bad System will beat a good person every time. 94 of problems in business are system driven`
  - Systems are stronger than individuals
- No matter how much someone is willing to do good work, if the system is challenging that effort will be reduced drastically
- How do you use techniques to drive your focus? How do you lead using System thinking?
1. Understand your objectives
2. Inspect the work as a series of systems
3. Actively manage your team's systems
How to achieve that within software?
Two main goals:
1. Teams have to be highly productive and continuously improve
2. Have engineers that are fulfilled and growing in their careers
In every team, there are Product, Engineering and People.
- Product
  - How does work gos from idea into production?
  - How is success defined?
  - How are requirements and tasks defined?
- Engineering
  - How are iterations managed?
  - How does a task go from creation to delivery?
  - How is quality verified?
- People
  - What are the feedback loops for engineers?
  - How does an engineer learn on the job?
  - How does career growth work?
- Instead of focusing on the parts, adjust the system
