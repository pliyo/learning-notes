  and you cannot predict the outcome of human development.
  All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions under which they will being to flourish`
  - Ken Robinson, educationalist.
- `Under systematic management, the best man rises to the top certainly and more rapidly than ever before`

- What do I want to learn? Define value
- What activities can generate value here? Map value stream
- How will I maintain progress? Create flow
- Where can I apply this in my work? Establish pull
- Concrete experience -> Reflective observation (reviewing, reflecting on the experience) ->
- abstract conceptualisation -> active experimentation -> concrete experience
