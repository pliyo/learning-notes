# Do you really need a platform team, by George Hantzaras (Director, Cloud Platform Engineering, Citrix Systems)

- Platform engineering is not here to replace DevOps or SRE. 
  - We want to work according to DevOps principles, and Platform Engineering is one way to achiev eit at ascale
  - Is one step in your DevOps journey
- Key aspects about evaluating Platform Engineering: Maturity
  - How far are we in the DevOps journey?
  - Where are we in terms of scaling? (Teams, services deployed...)
- Three pilar games of what happens afterward:
  - `Platform as a product` but not fanatically. Have proper platform product managers, and so on
  - The four pillars:
    - Developer experience
    - Increasing developer productivity
    - Promoting and assuring security and compliance
    - Excellence: Promoting standards and best practices
  - You don't start platform engineering, you grow into platform engineering
  - Platform engineering is what happen when DevOps engineers start talking to each other
