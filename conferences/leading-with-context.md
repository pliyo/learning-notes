# Leading software teams with context, by James Samuel (Engineering Manager, reddit)

When I became a manager I discovered that I was more accountable, even though I was not responsible for carrying out stuff.
    - Slow feedback loop.
- Teams want to know why. Upper management wants to know why. I want to know why.
- Leadership is influence and you need context to influence
- Context helps you make informed decisions
- Pilars of leading with visibility:
  - **Process**: Understand how stuff gets built on time and on budget
  - **Operation**: Understand if the stuff built will continue to run
  - **People**: Understand if the folks building the stuff are engaged and happy to continue building stuff
  - **Product**: Understand if users are happy and getting values from what is being built
- We tend to confuse process with rituals and ceremonies
  - Where are engineers actually spending their time?
    - **Architecture**: Does it allow your team to move fast?
    - **Dev experience**: Can teams build, scale and deploy services easily?
    - **Autonomy**: Are teams empowered to ideate, figure out things and deliver value independently?
    - **Speed**: Deployment frequency / Lead time for changes
    - **Stability**: Change fail rate (%) / Time to restore or recover
- You could use your 1:1s to figure things out. Even with skip level reports.
- DORA metrics. The four metrics used are:
  - Deployment frequency (DF).
  - Lead time for changes (LT).
  - Mean time to recovery (MTTR). 
  - Change failure rate (CFR).
- Understand if the stuff you are building will continue to run or be operable.
- Documentation: How easy is it to find and access documentation?
- Automation: What manual work the team does that can be automated?
- Processes: What processes are useful and what processes are obsolete?
- Tooling: How satisfied is the team with tooling used daily, eg: linters, IDE?
- Your organisation is experiencing growth if Complexity is high and Rate of change is high.
  - Realiability and performance will go under pressure when you grow.

- Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
  - SLIs: Key measurements to determine the relaibility of a system
  - SLOs: Goals that you set for how much reliability you expect out of a system
