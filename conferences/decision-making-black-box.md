# Decision making in black box scenarios, by Boyan Angelov

- The importance of decision making
  - `Not making a decision is actually a decision`
  - You gotta eat the soup you cook.
- When working with a legacy system, aim to be a Zen Monk:
  - Leave it be
  - Wait
    - Maybe people will find a workaround to the problem?
  - Don't rush
  - Respect the system
- When working with a legacy system, aim to be a Scientist:
  - Have a scientific approach
  - Recognise boundaries
  - Recognise relationships
  - Measure and change inputs and outputs
  - Replicate the system
- Become a system thinker (zen monk + scientist)
- A black box system while it exists it will always bite you
