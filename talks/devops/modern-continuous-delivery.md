- Some people in the operations team don't know how the business makes moeny.
  What is the business that McDonald is in? Real State.

- Use canary deployments to test that your business is actually working.

- Kubernetes allows you to do declarative deployments.

- Cattle not pets.

- Monitoring & Observability are different things. You want to make your application observable. Every incident is a murder mistery.

- Security has to be everybody's job. Snyk: Scan images, Static CVE Scan. Twistlock: Monitor runtime containers.

- Not everybody can be an expert of everything, you need the expertise on the team, not the person.

- Teams must be structured to own small pieces.

- Docker and Kubernetes are here to stay... until they don't

- You must test in production. Own it and architect for it.
