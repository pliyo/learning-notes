- What is the focus of your research?
  - Understanding their journey and trying to help them getting better and better
- What is the biggest challenge a tech lead faces?
  - When they move into a lead role you start being rewarded by how you enabled the whole team to produce, rather than what you produced.
- Any advice?
  - Step 1: Awareness. This role requires very different skills.
  - Step 2: Equiping people with skills to be successful in this role. Refactoring code, testing code, etc, not really prepare you to influence, helping people or overcome challenges.
  - Step 3: Ability to practise, and not wanting to fail too hard.
    - It's key to have support, fail to learn what not to do, organisation need to help giving people that sort of safety.
- What motivates you?
  - Raising the bar. We focus very much on tech skills and not on the hard skills which are actually the soft skills.
