# We're Agile, We don't do documentation

- We usually hear things like: "Docs are outdated as soon as we create them" or "our code is self documentation".
- As a lead, you might be thinking:
  - The team needs to share a common understanding.
  - Why did we choose technology X?
  - I just heard Tibo explaining that complex thing AGAIN!

# Purpose of documentation?

- Empathy with tech. Empathy with decisions.
- Empathy between product people and developers.
- Empathy with other technologist. Find out why the problem is hard, when it's solved nobody remembers anymore, use documentation to make better decisions.

# Take aways

- As little as possible.
- Make it visible.
- Create ownership through collaboration.
