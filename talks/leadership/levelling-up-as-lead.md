`Maker to multiplier`:

- When you start to work as lead you shift from being a maker to start being a maker multiplier.

  `Blurry is the new Binary`:

- There is rarely a best solution that will work for all types of people.
- Do you step in the basic decission making?
- Think about how you demostrate your own behaviour. People are looking at what you do, what you say, and that sets the role.

  `Motivate over Moan`:

- Ladder of inference: Actions - Beliefs - Conclusions - Assumptiosn - Interpreted Reality - Selected Realities - Realities and facts.
  - What are your default assumptions? We interpret things differently, there is no single truth out there.
- Make sure you inspire people.
