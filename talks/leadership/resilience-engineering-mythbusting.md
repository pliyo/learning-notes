- `Robustness`: Can the system perform within predetermined expected boundaries?

- `Resilience`: Can it adapt when the capacity to work is exceeded?

- `Resilience Engineering`: The practice on expanding of the efforts of understanding our systems. How do we prepare for the unknown? We need to invest on this continuously.

- `Retrospectives`: Actionable items are great, but they are not a requirement. The most important thing is: What can we learn from this?

- `Best practices`: Sometimes you need to push back.
