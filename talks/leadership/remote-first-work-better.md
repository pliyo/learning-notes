# Meetings

- Cocas: no rule son who talks, in what order or for how long.
  - the first person to utter something gets the floor.
  - sol: try having a moderator

# Time Zones

- Shield the development team with any work that interfieres with progress.
- Deep Work (recommended book). Downtime is recommended for everyone, no communication.
- Maintaining common ground, summarise context.
