# Archetypical Story

- The tech lead is not a promotion, it's a role change.
- Being torn between what you know: delivering vs leading a team
- In a career ladder, you would have expectations behaviour and impact for a given position. Agree what is the expectation in your role and level.
  - A career ladder can help guide a conversation, it's not a complete checklist, it reduces system bias.
- In the Valley they talk about two tracks: `Individual contributor` vs `Management`.
  - For Patrick it's a three track: `Technical Leader` / `Individual Contributor` and `Management`.
    - Think where do you spend the mayority of your time.
      - `Individual`: 70-80% Executing.
      - `Management`: 70-80% Managing the system. Ex: When to split a team? Planning? Budgeting? Organising?
      - `Tech Lead`: Aligning team. Ex: How do we split monolith? Technical Risk management: encouraging refactor, knowledge sharing, break big problems into smaller problems, tech vision, tech debt management, growing technical knowledge
- What got you here, won't get you there.

# What is a Tech Lead?

- A tech lead is a software engineer, responsible for leading a development team, and responsible for the quality of its technical deliverables.
- You need Architectural Skills, Developer Skills and Leadership Skills.
- The role requires effective leadership.
- At least 30% of the time with the team coding (reading, writing...)

# Surprises & Struggles

- Feeling alone.
- Uncertainty.
- People are puzzling: Unique, different strengths, archetypes not stereotypes. Try not to project your personal experience on somebody else just because it looks like something you know.
- Build a support structure.

# Tips to become a great tech lead

- Tell or delegate
  - Tell -> Sell -> Participate -> Delegate
- Tap into diverse approaches

`Eisenhower Matrix`:

- Important and Urgent: Do
- Important less Urgent: Decide
- Less important & Urgent: Delegate
- Less important & Less Urgent: Delete

- Move from Maker to Multiplayer mode.
