- Imagine you are managing someone better than you: How can I improve them?
  - I really wish someone asked me: You are an engineering manager now, what do you want to bring to the table that is a bit different than writing code?
  - An engineer manager need to understand how to make the team successful, how to improve the team overall.
  - I suggest people code reviewing their decissions: I would take more time writing down my own dilemas so I can review them.
    - Try one dilema per day, and consult with your line manager or your peers.
    - Software Leadership Weekly is a newsletter for leaders.

# Principles

- No broken windows: Alerts and exceptions come first before any new development.
- Know your black and white before you deal with the grey. Before you deal with "it depends" think about: What a beautiful code looks like? What success looks like? What would make the team furious? How does a healthy team looks like?
- Understand how each person sees success.
- Read business books so you can provide more clarity around the big picture.
- Measure twice, cut once. Once you finish the project: What are the things that you could have learned before?
