- Imagine you are managing someone better than you: How can I improve them?
  - I really wish someone asked me: You are an engineering manager now, what do you want to bring to the table that is a bit different than writing code?
  - An engineer manager need to understand how to make the team successful, how to improve the team overall.
  - I suggest people code reviewing their decissions: I would take more time writing down my own dilemas so I can review them.
    - Try one dilema per day, and consult with your line manager or your peers.
