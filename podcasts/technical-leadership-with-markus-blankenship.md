**What makes a technical leader? What do you think prevents people from becoming great technical leaders?**

- Joe Amber definition is: "Creation an environment where everyone can fully participate on solving the problems at hand". We aren't here just to tell people what to do. Managers don't know best.
- Something that gets in the way often is: Feeling too constraint with management, or that there is too little management.
- There is a sense of modelling behaviour, you are always being watch inferring what is right or what is wrong. What you care about, and how to act.
  - If you solve all the problems, you are missing an oportunity for the teams to grow.
- 1 to 1s. Creating individual relationships. A meeting requests is a promise that we are going to get together and have a conversation. At the end of the day we are trying to optimise for building trust.
- Priviledges for managers separate them from the team.

# Any techniques to discover the context of a project?

- Passing it from sales could be a way
- Accurate vs Precise.
- It's all about balance, collecting data, and finding ways to improve.
- Practices: daily journal that we share asynchronously, then weekly retro.
- Most managers believe they need to have answers, but often the team is the best consultant team. Go to them to find the answers, and be open about it.
