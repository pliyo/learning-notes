- `What is the concept of technical leader for you?`

  - I prefer the term leader over manager. When people see manager they see title and a position, when people see leader they see an act. I believe everyone can be a leader if they are passionate about it [...] there is something about leading the technical vision, an overlap between general leadership management skills, experience building systems and the ability of crafting code.

- `Tell us about encouraging 30% of time doing code`

  - I value feedback loop [...] They need to code so they can understand the decisions they make, and it's good that you are able to make decisions. It's hard to do that if you don't have the respect of the people. (Coding will give that)

- `What's your thought as you get further up away from the code?`

  - I try to focus on principles, those are the things that trascend all technology stacks. [...] Sometimes you try to optimise across a broad expectrum, so you need to understand tradeoffs, maybe sitting down with different teams, or doing technical retrospectives or prototyping. There shouldn't be an expectation that you can answer the latest framework or tool, but there is a lot of wisdom around how systems are built and why.
    Sometimes you might be able to influence architecture patterns.

- `What's the difference between Engineering Manager and Tech Lead?`

  - Engineering manager might be coming from scrum master or project manager, making sure teams have the right relationship, maybe responsible for personal development, but they not necessarilly have the skill to lead the technical side of things. [...] Where I see it more successfuly is when the engineering manager focus on the political side of the organisation, and the Tech lead focuses on the system technical vision. In some places you might have that person that is able to do both.

- `Do you think teams can scale to be larger if you have that pair?`

  - Absolutely, I have seen you can get up to 12 or 15 developers that way.

- `What are the most common developers Teach Lead making?`

  - Innavibility to delegate.

- `Can you quantify the improvements when you have properly educated Tech Leadership?`

  - I see it as a risk management for organisations. Good team morale and a cohesive teams.

- `Anything from the top of your head you'd recommend?`

  - Yes, leading snowflakes (a book). Continuous Delivery (book) from a big architecture perspective.

- `Recommendations for new Tech Leads?`

  - First, can you articulate your technical vision as an elevator pitch? What type of system you are building? How does this makes people excited to work on that?
  - The second thing, start reading about people.

- `How do you face impostor syndrome?`

  - Ability to create a feedback loop is key, so if you are going to fail you fail quickly.
  - Get feedback from peers.

- `Any last recommendations for people thinking on stepping into the role?`
  - You would end up doing less code, but you can also build a system much better than what you would be able to do alone.
  - Instead of you coding, you code through people.
